# Test your vocabulary
## What?
A game in which you need to enter as many (correct) words as you can, this in a certain amount of time or just to check the state of your vocabulary (indefinitely)
## Why?
I think it's an interesting challenge by which you can acquire new knowledge. 
#### Additional feature:
Give the user definitions and words they haven't used yet to enlarge their knowledge.
