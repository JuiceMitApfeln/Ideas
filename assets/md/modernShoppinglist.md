# Modern shoppinglist
## What?
App that allows you to add new items to your shoppinglist, create shoppinglist templates (so you don't have to add the same items everytime), "remove" items from the list,...
## Why?
Now I have a basic template on google-docs that I print everytime I go shopping. This list gives me a basic idea of things that could be handy to have in stock or just buy.
I have seen apps that do this but I haven't seen an app that you can store a basic/exteded list in and where I can use templates, because 70% of the items you need to buy every week are the same. 
#### Possible future addition:
- With AI and cameras in closets, the AI determine what is out of stock or nearly out of stock and should be added to the lists.
