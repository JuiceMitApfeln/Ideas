# Job applier

## What?

App that seeks related jobs with related job-descriptions and allow you to enter a "default" letter with a different implementation for each company.

## Why?

While applying for an internship, I found that it would have been easier to see on a platform X companies related to my major, add the ones I'm interested in to a list and then just upload a default letter with different implementation for each company. I have basically done the same now but manually and it took way too long. That's why I'm certain that there is a market for this app.

## How?
