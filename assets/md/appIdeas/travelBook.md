# Travel book

## What?

App that is a new form of social media like instagram combined with google maps.

## Why?

I like to keep pictures organized and neat. This app would allow me to save/pin pictures to a certain location in a way that a few pictures are highlighted like on instagram (but if you click on ??? you get to see a whole photo-book), add new locations I've been to (but not necessarily have pictures of).
And a timeline that shows pictures from your friends/people you follow

## How?
