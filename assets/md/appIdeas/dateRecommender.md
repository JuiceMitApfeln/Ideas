# Date recommender

## What?

App that seeks potential dates for you (like in the netflix series black mirror) and by doing so tries to find the "ideal" partner for you. The difference with date applications of nowadays is that you need to spend a lot of time on them to find a potential match and it is often based on a persons looks instead of unbaised reviews/shared interests/... of someone.
