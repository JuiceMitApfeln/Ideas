Every time when I am trying to learn any topic through books, I am looking for books’ selections that can help me to handle a topic and every time I encounter the same problems:

The majority of books’ selections is subjective

In order to make them objective, I should spend a bunch of time on analyzing a lot of selections, on searching the best books on the selections, on understanding why should I read the book and where I can apply what I read, and finally - reading a huge number of reviews - all these steps take me several hours to complete.

If I do not make them objective, I often waste money and time on shitty books.

I asked my friends, and do you know what? Of course, you know what, they have the same problems.

Therefore, I decided to create an app that can help me, my friends, and other people, who want to get structured and modern knowledge using the books.

The app brings together the best books. They are all organized by topics. Also, each book has a structured description to help you understand what is in the book and why to read it.

Why is it objective???

Our team analyzes information from all over the internet. Dozens of articles, videos, hundreds of reviews, plenty of conversations with professionals on forums. Thus, you get the most objective books’ selections.

If you like the idea – download the app and try it, maybe you will find something useful for yourself.

The app is in the MVP stage; therefore, I ask everyone who is interested in the development of this idea to give feedback in the comments on google play or here. Any suggestions and criticism.

If we unite ideas, we can make self-education more convenient and better.
