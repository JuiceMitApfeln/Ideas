# Natural Car Trip

## What?

App that recommends beautiful routes near nature or interesting places to drive through. Google maps but with beautiful and interesting routes instead of highway, highway, highway.

## Why?

I would love to do a roadtrip to X, on which I can visit other interesting places as well. Sort of sightseeing since you're going that way anyway.

## How?

# Spin off ideas:

1. # Beautiful nature

## What?

App that shows you nearby beautiful places based on the rating of previous visits by other users.

## Why?

I find that people don't spend enough time outside. I believe an app like this can encourage people to go more outside.
