# Are you bored?

## What?

App that gives you ideas on what you can do when you're bored.

## Why?

I'm bored a lot and don't know what kind of fun stuff I could do. There are a lot of useless videos on youtube that recommend useless stuff (aka pure shit), as there are websites and applications. Instead of the uselessness things getting spread I'd rather opt in on an all out good application that can deliver interesting activities to do... 

## How?
