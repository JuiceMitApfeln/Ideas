# Give me variable names

## What?

App that gives you a variable name based on a set of keywords.

## Why?

I find it (sometimes) really difficult and annoying to come up with the right variable name for the right variable. This app would make my life easier by me giving a few keywords like "pink, red, green, blue" and then that it generates a useful variable name => colors.

## How?
