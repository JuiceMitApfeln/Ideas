# Image Story Multiplay game

## What?

You get X card with an image on them. There are Y Turns and every turn you write something about a card and add an image that resembles the card.
To get points you need to guess which image best suites the given description by the user who chose the card, if someone guesses incorrectly the person they guessed gets points, if everyone guesses right everyone gets points but the person who gave up the description (clearly the description was too specific and not deserving of points).
