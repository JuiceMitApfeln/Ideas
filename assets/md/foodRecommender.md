# Food recommender

## What?

App that recommends food from nearby restaurants or food you can make yourself

## Why?

Sometimes I find it hard to come up with something that I would like to make. So, then I go searching online for something. Most websites then give strange recipes / hard to make recipes.
It would be easier if I just could select the ingredients I have at my disposal and get a recipe that's good/new/refreshing/delicious based of that.

## How?

1. Make or use an API
2. Generate several recipes based of the ingredients someone has at their disposal
