# My journal

## What?

App that is the modern equivalent of a journal. Users have different templates for different journals. The could be differentaition between public journals (more like a blog), private journals and protected journals (journals not open to the public but can be shared between friends).

## Why?

I remember as a kid having a journal. I wouldn't write too much in it, but I think that a kid-friendly journal app could be cool.
There are several ways to accomplish this coolness factor.
Although, I personally wouldn't limit my potential users to only kids, this is an interesting idea.
